# VARIABLES, EXPRESSION & STATEMENTS


test

testing github push

GIT = SOFTWARE THAT PUSH, PULLS & COMMITS CHANGES TO FILES FROM LOCAL REPO TO EXTERNAL REPO (GITHUB, BITBUCKET, ETC..)

GIT HUB = EXTERNAL REPO ON THE WEB, BITBUCKET, ETC... MANY PRODUCTS SOURCE TREE LOCAL GIT PROGRAM.. CAN USE ANY PROGRAM TO MAKE CHANGES WITH GIT OR CLI

CI/CD - VSC > JENKINS > GIT > EXTERNAL REPO - CONTINUIUS INTERGRATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF CODE CHANGES AND TESTING

*** OPEN SOURCE CONTROL IS VSCODE OR EXTERNAL APP *** ADD NOTES & PUSH ***


PROGRESS 01282023 - VARIABLES, EXPRESSIONS AND STATEMENTS 

45:00 

git test Windows

python - make sure interpreter is working - run python file from directory

reserved words= python syntax words vocabulary (class )

Variables - whatever word we use 

interractive python - use statements for testin
script - write the program

sequence of steps - type the steps and python runs iter
conditional steps - more intelligent sequence of steps using (if) statements
repeated steps - steps over and over again (loops)

constants - fixed values number,letters that don't change

keep variables simple and meaning

variable - word we choose 
operator - = 
assignement - value for variable

x = 3.9 

CHAPTER 2 

expressions - 

operators - () + - / * **

"type" asks variable types

# Comments are ignored by python #

# Get the name of the file and open it
name = input('Enter file:')
handle = open(name, 'r')

CHAPTER 3 - CONDITIONAL EXECUTION

if statement = check something in the code 

git changes - enter message in box before commit
