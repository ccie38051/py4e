#####PYTHON TRAINING CHUCK

# INSTALL
 - Windows, Mac or Linux
 - Install python3
 - create folder
 - Install IDE - ATOM works for all OS, same VSC
 - Create file first.py in directory
 - Run file from directory or CLI
 - Create note files in python

 Python is basically words, sentences & paragraphs of code
 reserved words for python:
 False
 None
 True

# VARIABLES, EXPRESSION & STATEMENTS


test

testing github push

GIT = SOFTWARE THAT PUSH, PULLS & COMMITS CHANGES TO FILES FROM LOCAL REPO TO EXTERNAL REPO (GITHUB, BITBUCKET, ETC..)

GIT HUB = EXTERNAL REPO ON THE WEB, BITBUCKET, ETC... MANY PRODUCTS SOURCE TREE LOCAL GIT PROGRAM.. CAN USE ANY PROGRAM TO MAKE CHANGES WITH GIT OR CLI

CI/CD - VSC > JENKINS > GIT > EXTERNAL REPO - CONTINUIUS INTERGRATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF CODE CHANGES AND TESTING

*** OPEN SOURCE CONTROL IS VSCODE OR EXTERNAL APP *** ADD NOTES & PUSH ***


PROGRESS 01282023 - VARIABLES, EXPRESSIONS AND STATEMENTS 

45:00 

git test Windows

python - make sure interpreter is working - run python file from directory

reserved words= python syntax words vocabulary (class )

Variables - whatever word we use 

interractive python - use statements for testin
script - write the program

sequence of steps - type the steps and python runs iter
conditional steps - more intelligent sequence of steps using (if) statements
repeated steps - steps over and over again (loops)

constants - fixed values number,letters that don't change

keep variables simple and meaning

variable - word we choose 
operator - = 
assignement - value for variable

x = 3.9 

CHAPTER 2 

expressions - 

operators - () + - / * **

"type" asks variable types

# Comments are ignored by python #

# Get the name of the file and open it
name = input('Enter file:')
handle = open(name, 'r')

CHAPTER 3 - CONDITIONAL EXECUTION

paragraphs of code with the if statement. run the code and if we find something run that code
if not move to the next lines of code

if, then else conditions statement = check something in the code 


git changes - enter message in box before commit

stage > commit > sync 

code blocks and indents key to paragraphed code. visualize flow of if then logic

COMPLEX CONDITIONAL EXECUTIONS

*clone git repo* pull, commit and push changes* 

repo - github, bitbucket etc..
git - git CLI, bamboo, bithub etc..


CHAPTER 4 - FUNCTIONS 

Store and reuse 

def = store the defined function 

def thing():
print ('Hello') 
print ('Fun') 

invoke (call) the function to use: 

print thing()

def greet(lang):
    if lang == 'es': 
       return 'Hola'
elif lang == 'fr'
      return 'Bonjour'
else:
     return 'Hello'

>>> print(greet('en'), 'Glenn')
>>> Hello Glenn

To function or not to function.....

* used for long and complex forms of code where things are being used over nad over again


CHAPTER 5: LOOPS AND ITERATIONS 

Python loops are used to execute a set of instructions repeatedly. There are two types of loops in Python: for loop and while loop.

A 'for' loop is used to iterate over a sequence of elements and execute a block of code for each element in the sequence.

A 'while' loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of code as long as a condition is true.

Both types of loops can be used to iterate over lists, tuples, strings, and other types of collections in Python.

# Example of for loop
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
for num in numbers:
    print(num)

# Output: 
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
# 5

# Example of while loop
count = 0
while count < 5:
    print(count)
    count += 1

# Output:
# 0
# 1
# 2
# 3
# 4
